# Workout-Tracker
Utilized binding in Swift to create multiple custom SwiftUI views in Xcode for a workout tracker app that stored user data by week and allowed users to add and clear customized workout data.
In the future, I hope to implement a database to store multiple weeks worth of data.
To use, download the Xcode projects files and run the .xcodeproj file.
